# Online Course Enrollment System

A simple Python program that simulates an online course enrollment system using the terminal.

I made this project to practice basic Python concepts such as dictionaries, sets, functions, loops, and input validation.

## What the Program Can Do

- Show available courses
- Enroll a student in a course
- Drop a student from a course
- View students enrolled in each course
- Check common students between two courses
- Check students enrolled in one course but not in another
- Exit the program

## Courses Included

- JAVASCRIPT
- PYTHON
- JAVA
- HTML
- PHP
- CSS

## How It Works

- The program shows a menu.
- The user chooses an option (ENROLL, DROP, VIEW, etc.).
- The program asks for the needed inputs.
- Student names are stored using sets to avoid duplicates.
- The program keeps running until the user chooses `EXIT`.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Run the file using:
python online_course_enrollment_system.py

## Sample Menu

ENROLL     - Enroll to a course
DROP       - Drop from a course
VIEW       - View all students enrolled
OVERLAPS   - View common names enrolled
DIFFERENCE - View difference
EXIT       - Exit program

## What I Learned
• How to use dictionaries and sets
• How to create and reuse functions
• Why input validation is important
• How abstraction helps reduce repeated code

## Possible Improvements
• Save enrolled students to a file
• Improve design and output formatting
• Turn this into a GUI or website in the future
